The Wind Rises presents a heartbreakingly beautiful love story in which Jiro's ill-fated fianc√©e Nahoko Satomi becomes his muse, interwoven with victories and losses. Jiro is able to anchor his head-in-the-clouds illusions in the actual world of human contact, love, and, inevitably, loss as a result of this.
